    <h1>To A Really Special Cutie ðŸ’–</h1>
    <p>To start off I wanted to say I care about you a lot. I struggle a lot to find the words to show how much I care. So here's my attempt.</p>

    <p>You mean so much to me. I think about you all the time, about us being together. I'm so glad I told you how I felt that day. Everything that's happened since has made me so happy and I wouldn't take back a moment of it.</p>

    <p>One day I wish to be wrapping my arms around you instead of my pillow. I imagine it everyday. You are so adorable. Can you really blame me for constantly thinking about you?</p>

    <p>You've reassured me and helped me through so much. I've never been one to share my feelings but you make it feel so easy and natural. If I could help you through even a fraction of how much you helped me I would be so happy.</p>

    <p>I know things aren't going the best for you right now and you see yourself as a mess. I know it may take a while for anything between us to happen. I want you see you get better and I will always do whatever I possibly can to make that happen. You are worth so much to me and I wanna see you succeed at everything you do!</p>

    <p>Everything you do warms my heart. The matching pfps, wallpapers, playlist, and especially the sleep calls and WRITING THAT BOOK FOR ME HELLOOO!! Have all been so cute. You make me so shy but also so comfortable. I love everything you do.</p>

    <p>I could probably keep calling you cute but I would run out of room on this page so I'll leave it at this. You are beautiful. You are amazing. I LOVE YOU SO MUCHH!!</p>
